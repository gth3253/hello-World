# hello-World
It's my first project learning how to use github
I don't even know how to use Github, it's so frustrating. I guess I'll just follow the "How-to" guide and see how it goes. Don't worry, you'll become a web-developer soon! I promise. 

I'm just updating some of my profile since I decided to give Github another try!
